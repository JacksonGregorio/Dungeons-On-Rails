        <p class="mt-4">
            Dungeons On Rails is a role-playing game (RPG) where players embark on epic adventures in a fantasy world.
            In an RPG, players assume the roles of characters and navigate through a story-driven narrative, making choices and engaging in battles along the way.
            The game offers a rich and immersive experience, allowing players to customize their characters, explore vast landscapes, and interact with non-player characters (NPCs).
            Whether you're a seasoned RPG player or new to the genre, Dungeons On Rails offers endless possibilities for adventure and excitement.
